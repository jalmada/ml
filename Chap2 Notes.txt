Housing Exmple:
    - Supervised Learning.
    - Regression task
    - Multivariate Regression
    - Batch Learning

Note: If the dataset is huge the batch could be splited using MapReduce technique.

Selecting a performance measure.

Root Mean Squar Error (RMSE)
Gives an Idea of how much error a system makes in its predictions.
Higher wait for larger errors.
    - See equation on book.
    - m = number of data rows in the data set (instancea).
    - x^(i) = vecto with the properties at the row i
    - X is a matrix with the values the dataset?
    - h = Prediction Function
    - y^(i) = the expected result after aplying the hypotesis

When having too many outliers maybe the MAE (Mean Absolute Error/Average Absolute Deviation) could be a better option.

RMSE ignores little errors and show big ones, also is good when having data in a bell shape curve.
