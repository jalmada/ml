1. Cleanup data
    1. Select a Performance Measure.
    2. Create a Train and Test sets.
    3. Define strata/categories if needed for continous values, setting an appropiate range.. 
    4. Do stratified samplin based on the new category


Housing Exmple:
    - Supervised Learning.
    - Regression task
    - Multivariate Regression
    - Batch Learning

Note: If the dataset is huge the batch could be splited using MapReduce technique.

- Selecting a performance measure.

Root Mean Squar Error (RMSE)
Gives an Idea of how much error a system makes in its predictions.
Higher wait for larger errors.
    - See equation on book.
    - m = number of data rows in the data set (instancea).
    - x^(i) = vecto with the properties at the row i
    - X is a matrix with the values the dataset?
    - h = Prediction Function
    - y^(i) = the expected result after aplying the hypotesis

When having too many outliers maybe the MAE (Mean Absolute Error/Average Absolute Deviation) could be a better option.

RMSE ignores little errors and show big ones, also is good when having data in a bell shape curve.

- Getting the data

Tail heavy distributions affect an accurrate prediction, this data needs to be handled. Its better to get a bell shaped curve

- Create a Test set.
    Before doing anything else get a subset of the data and save it a a test set, we shouldnt look at it at all.
    Normaly a test set is about 20% of the total data

    Spliting the data can be done randomly, using an index in the data set or an Id.
    Scikit-learn provides its own functions for spliting a data set (train_test_split), you can pass more than one data set and it will split both based on the same indices. this is helpful if the labels are in another dataset.

    When sampling we need to be sure that all the variations are represented, its ok for big datasets

- Add Categories or strata 

    Stratified Sampling: Get a representative sample of the current data distribution, ex: if the us pop is 58% female and 42% male the sample should meet that ratio
    This homogeneous groups are called strata

- Remove  Categories and strata so the data is back to normal

- Look for Correlations

    Using the standard correlation coefficient (Pearson's r), between all the attributes.
    This is only for linear correlations as non linear could be completely missed
    correlation foes from 1 to -1, 
        1 being a strong positive correlation (the more something the more something else)
        0 not having a correlation betwenn 2 attributes.
        -1 being a strong negative correlation te more something the less something else)


- Experimenting with Attributes combinations.
